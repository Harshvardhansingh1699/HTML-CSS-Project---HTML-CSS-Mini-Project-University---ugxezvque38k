These activities are the vital component in bringing about the all-directional development of the students. The games like soccer, kabaddi, chess, cricket, badminton, table tennis, hockey, volley ball, crickets etc are played at the inter-collegiate and nodal level. The excellent sportspersons are awarded with medals, trophies, shields, cups and certificates.
